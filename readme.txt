Knowd (pronounced "node") is the easiest way to drive engaged readers to your website or blog.

== Description ==

Knowd (pronounced "node") is the easiest way to drive engaged readers to your website or blog.  You simply need to download and install our sleek looking traffic widget, register your site with us.  Once your website is part of the Knowd community, your content will be promoted on Knowd widgets throughout our global network of leading websites.  Our widgets can be used by any safe for work website (sorry NSFW), regardless of your choice in platform.  From start to finish, setup takes most website owners less than 5 minutes and the installation process is easy regardless of your programming background.  Also, if for whatever reason you are ever unhappy with the service, you can remove the Knowd widget as easily as you installed it. Our service is free so just sign-up already!

= How does it work? =

After the 5-minute installation of your new widgets, you will be asked to upload links of your best content to our system. Once uploaded and approved (we need to keep it clean), our system will deliver your content to our widgets across the Web and start sending readers back to your site. Of course, it is a lot more complicated than that as we use a number of algorithms and real time data to understand specific readers' interests and deliver content they find compelling. The result: engaged readers are introduced to your website and your content, increasing your revenue and building your audience.

= How much traffic should you expect? =

Well, that depends on two things: (i) the amount of traffic you send us through your widget and (ii) the "clickiness" of your content on our network. For instance, if 100 readers click on your Knowd widget in a day, you should expect to get 100 to 200 readers sent to your website. Where in that range your returned traffic ultimately falls is largely dependent on the quality of your content. Why? It's not easy to find the reader who gets excited about a link to "5 Boring Stamps".

= Why do you want traffic? =

There is the obvious answer of more traffic, which means more pageviews, which means more ad impressions, which means more dollars for you. There is also the less obvious yet arguably more important benefit of having new and engaged readers introduced to your site, which is how you grow your audience.
